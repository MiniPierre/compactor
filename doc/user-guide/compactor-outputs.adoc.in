==== Outputs

*-o, --output* _PATTERN_::
  Use _PATTERN_ as the template for the file path for the C-DNS output files. If no output
  pattern is given, no output is written.

*-z, --gzip-output* [_arg_]::
  Compress data in the C-DNS output files using gzip(1) format. _arg_ may be
  `true` or `1` to  enable compression, `false` or `0` to disable compression.
  If _arg_ is omitted,  it defaults to `true`. If compression is enabled, an
  extension `.gz` is added to  the output filename.

*-y, --gzip-level* [_arg_]::
  Compression level to use when producing gzip(1) C-DNS output. _arg_ must be
  a single digit `0` to `9`.  If not specified, the default level is `6`.

*-x, --xz-output* [_arg_]::
  Compress data in the C-DNS output files using xz(1) format. _arg_ may be `true`
  or `1` to enable compression, `false` or `0` to disable compression. If _arg_ is omitted,
  it defaults to `true`. If compression is enabled, an extension `.xz` is added to
  the output filename.

*-u, --xz-preset* [_arg_]::
  Compression preset level to use when producing xz(1) C-DNS output. _arg_ must be
  a single digit `0` to `9`.  If not specified, the default level is `6`.

*--max-compression-threads* [_arg_]::
  Maximum number of threads to use when compressing. Compression uses
  one thread per output file, so this argument gives the number of
  output files that can be compressed simultaneously. _arg_ must be
  `1` or more.  If not specified, the default number of threads is `2`.

*-w, --raw-pcap* _PATTERN_::
  Use _PATTERN_ as the template for a file path for output of all packets captured
  via network capture to file in PCAP format. If no pattern is given, no raw packet
  output is written. This option is currently ignored when capturing via DNSTAP.

*-m, --ignored-pcap* _PATTERN_::
  Use _PATTERN_ as the template for a file path for output of all packets captured
  vai network capture that were not to the configured DNS ports, or were not validly
  formed DNS packets. If no pattern is given, no ignored packet output is written.
  This option is currently ignored when capturing via DNSTAP.

*-Z, --gzip-pcap* [_arg_]::
  Compress data in the PCAP output files using gzip(1) format. _arg_ may be
  `true` or `1` to  enable compression, `false` or `0` to disable compression.
  If _arg_ is omitted,  it defaults to `true`. If compression is enabled, an
  extension `.gz` is added to  the output filename.

*-Y, --gzip-level-pcap* [_arg_]::
  Compression level to use when producing gzip(1) PCAP output. _arg_ must be
  a single digit `0` to `9`.  If not specified, the default level is `6`.

*-X, --xz-pcap* [_arg_]::
  Compress data in the PCAP output files using xz(1) format. _arg_ may be `true`
  or `1` to enable compression, `false` or `0` to disable compression. If _arg_ is omitted,
  it defaults to `true`. If compression is enabled, an extension `.xz` is added to
  the output filename.

*-U, --xz-preset-pcap* [_arg_]::
  Compression preset level to use when producing xz(1) C-DNS output. _arg_ must be
  a single digit `0` to `9`.  If not specified, the default level is `6`.

*-t, --rotation-period* _SECONDS_::
  Specify the frequency with which all output file path patterns should be
  re-examined. If the file path has changed after this period (e.g. because it
  contains a date/time element which has changed), the existing output file is
  closed and a new one opened using the new pattern expansion. If the file path
  has not changed, the pattern is re-examined every second until it changes.
  Note that file path patterns that do not contain date/time elements will
  therefore not trigger file rotation via this mechanism, so using a default
  file pattern similar that that in the default configuration file is
  recommended. The default period is 300 seconds. This may be combined with
  maximum output file size rotation, in which case rotation happens when either
  condition is met.

*-n, --include* _SECTIONS_::
  Indicate which optional sections should be included in the main output. This argument
  can be given multiple times. By default none of these optional sections are included.
  This option is deprecated. and will be removed in a future release. It is replaced by
  the `excludesfile` option. See the user guide for more information.

*-G, --ignore-opcode* _OPCODE_::
   Indicate an opcode _OPCODE_ that should not be included in the main output.
   This argument can be given multiple times.

*-E, --accept-opcode* _OPCODE_::
   Indicate an opcode _OPCODE_ that should be included in the main output.
   This argument can be given multiple times.

*-g, --ignore-rr-type* _TYPE_::
   Indicate an RR type _TYPE_ that should not be included in the main output.
   The first question is always included, but _TYPE_ nominated using the RR type
   name (in upper case)  will be omitted from any other question and from
   any Answer, Authority or  Additional section. This argument can be given
   multiple times.

*-e, --accept-rr-type* _TYPE_::
   Indicate an RR type _TYPE_ that should be included in the main output.
   The first question is always included, but only _TYPE_ nominated using
   the RR type name (in upper case) will be included in any other question
   and in any Answer,  Authority or Additional section. This argument can be
   given multiple times.

*--max-block-items* _arg_::
   Set the maximum number of query/response items  or address event items
   included in a single output C-DNS block. _arg_ must be a positive integer.
   The default maximum size is 5000.

*--max-output-size* _arg_::
   Sets a maximum size for the uncompressed output before an output file
   rotation is triggered. _arg_ must be a positive integer, and may optionally
   be followed by one of the following multiplicative suffixes: _k_=1024, _K_=1000,
   _m_=1024*1024, _M_=1000*1000 and similarly for _g_, and _t_.
   If a file rotation is triggered, the remaining block and the file postlude will
   be written, so the final file size will exceed this setting by a small margin. The
   default value is 0, which indicates there is no maximum size.
   This may be combined with a rotation period, in which case
   rotation happens when either condition is met.

*--client-address-prefix-ipv4* _arg_::
   Set the prefix size (number of address bits stored) for IPv4 client addresses.
   The client address is the address of the sender of a query or the receipient
   of a response.  _arg_ must be a positive integer less than or equal to 32.
   The default is 32, so the entire IPv4 address is stored.

*--client-address-prefix-ipv6* _arg_::
   Set the prefix size (number of address bits stored) for IPv6 client addresses.
   The client address is the address of the sender of a query or the receipient
   of a response.  _arg_ must be a positive integer less than or equal to 128.
   The default is 128, so the entire IPv6 address is stored.

*--server-address-prefix-ipv4* _arg_::
   Set the prefix size (number of address bits stored) for IPv4 server addresses.
   The server address is the address of the recipient of a query or the sender
   of a response.  _arg_ must be a positive integer less than or equal to 32.
   The default is 32, so the entire IPv4 address is stored.

*--server-address-prefix-ipv6* _arg_::
   Set the prefix size (number of address bits stored) for IPv6 server addresses.
   The server address is the address of the recipient of a query or the sender
   of a response.  _arg_ must be a positive integer less than or equal to 128.
   The default is 128, so the entire IPv6 address is stored.
