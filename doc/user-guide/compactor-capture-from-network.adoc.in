==== Capture from network

*-i, --interface* _arg_::
  Capture traffic from network interface _arg_. This argument may be given multiple
  times to allow capture for several interfaces in parallel.

*-S, --server-address-hint* _arg_::
  _arg_ is a single IPv4 or IPv6 address for the server. These hints are optional, do not
  affect capture in any way, but are stored in C-DNS as a potential aide to
  post-capture analysis. If capture from one or more interfaces is specified, then
  a sanity check is performed to ensure the address is be present on a system
  interface; if not, an error is logged, but collection proceeds. This argument may
  be given multiple times.

*-f, --filter* _arg_::
  Discard packets not matching the filter expression _arg_. The filter syntax is described
  in *pcap-filter*(7). Packets are discarded at the point of capture; discarded packets
  do not appear in any ignored PCAP output file.

*--dns-port* _arg_::
  Traffic to or from port _arg_ is DNS traffic and should be recorded. Traffic to
  other ports is ignored. The default is 53.

*-s, --snaplen* _arg_::
  Capture up to _arg_ bytes per packet. The default is 65535.

*-p, --promiscuous-mode* [_arg_]:: Put the interface into promiscuous
  mode. _arg_ may be `true` or `1` to enable promiscuous mode,
  `false` or `0` to disable promiscuous mode. If _arg_ is omitted, it
  defaults to `true`. Promiscuous mode is disabled by default.

*-a, --vlan-id* _arg_::
  ID of VLAN to be captured if on a 802.1Q network. The argument may be given
  multiple times to capture from several VLANs. If no *vlan-id* argument is given,
  traffic is captured from all VLANs.

*-L, --log-network-stats-period* _arg_::
  Every _arg_ seconds, log basic statistics on packet collection to the system log. The
  default value of 0 disables this logging.

*-F, --log-file-handling*::
  Log detailed file processing when files are rotated and compressed. This facilitates
  debugging of file processing issues and measurement of file compression times.

*--sampling-threshold* _arg_::
  A threshold for the percentage of traffic dropped on the internal channels above which
  sampling will be enabled (if *sampling-rate* is greater than 0). The
  default value is 10.

*--sampling-rate* _arg_::
  The rate (1 in _arg_ packets) to be applied when sampling mode is enabled (this is an 
  experimental feature). The rate is applied for *sampling-time* seconds and then sampling
  is disabled. After this, depending on the traffic rate, sampling may be enabled again if the drops rise
  above the *sampling-threshold*. The default value of 0 disables this option.

*--sampling-time* _arg_::
  The period of time to apply sampling mode for. To avoid accidentally setting a low value
  that could result in instability this must be at least 10s. The default value is 100.
