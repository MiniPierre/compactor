# Check that test content C-DNS values are as expected, and --debug-qr
# output is as expected.
#
# The test content currently is two queries and matching responses.
# The first query is IPv4 with trailing query data, the second
# is IPv6.
#
# There are problems currently with cbor2json (which crashes on the
# strings) and cbor2yaml (which breaks binary string content into
# output lines on xenial but not on mac). cbor2diag is consistent,
# so use that.
